## How to Use This Repository

To use this repository, clone it to your local machine, ensuring that R and all necessary packages are installed. Begin executing the notebooks in the order specified below, making sure all dependencies and data paths are correctly configured. Although the workding derectory is automatically detected in each notebooks, adjust paths and configurations might be necessary based on your local environment.

### `Functions`

This folder contains R scripts defining functions used throughout the data processing and analysis pipelines. These functions are called by the notebooks in the `notebooks` folder to perform various data manipulation and analysis tasks.

- **A0 Package Setup.R**: A setup script that is universally required by all notebooks. It prepares the R environment by loading necessary packages and setting configurations.
- **Text Preparation Functions**: Scripts like `00.1 text_preparation_functions.R` and others define functions for text processing such as stemming, concatenation, and normalization.
- **Data Handling Functions**: Includes functions for reading CSV files (`00.5a function reading csv.R`), summarizing data (`00.5b function summarise dimensions.R`), and other data manipulation tasks.

### `notebooks`

This folder contains R Markdown notebooks that sequentially process and analyze data. The notebooks should be run in the following order to ensure that data flows correctly through the stages of the pipeline:

1. **B0 CRS Data Processing.Rmd**: Start here to process the initial CRS data.
2. **B1 Hash and assign db_ref.Rmd**: Continues data processing by assigning database references.
3. **C0 Add Makers and desc_2mine.Rmd**, **C1 Wrangling and create maker files.Rmd**: These notebooks add additional data layers and prepare maker files.
4. **D0 Language detection.Rmd**: Detects the language of the data entries.
5. **E0 Data analysis pipeline.Rmd**: The main analysis script which processes data through the full pipeline and stores results in `/Data/intermediate`.
6. **F0 Manual checking.Rmd**: Provides tools to manually inspect results, allowing for manual review and verification of data items and corresponding details.

#### Important Notes:
- Ensure **A0 Package Setup.R** is successfully run in each notebook to set up the environment.
- Results from `E0 Data analysis pipeline.Rmd` are stored in subfolders within the `/Data/intermediate` directory, ensuring that output is organized and accessible.
- Use `F0 Manual checking.Rmd` to manually inspect and verify results as needed, providing a crucial check on data integrity and accuracy.

## Data Folder Structure
